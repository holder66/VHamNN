## Example: typical use case, a clinical risk calculator

Health care professionals frequently make use of calculators to inform clinical decision-making. Data regarding symptoms, findings on physical examination, laboratory and imaging results, and outcome information such as diagnosis, risk for developing a condition, or response to specific treatments, is collected for a sample of patients, and then used to form the basis of a formula that can be used to predict the outcome information of interest for a new patient, based on how their symptoms and findings, etc. compare to those in the dataset.

Here we use the HamNN classifier to generate a clinical risk calculator, using the [Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29). This data consists of the pathological findings on biopsies of breast lumps from 699 women; subsequent surgery in these patients determined whether the lump was benign or cancerous. Each case includes values for nine attributes (rating various aspects of the cell nucleus when examined under a microscope, on a scale from 1 to 10).

We can run a set of exploratory cross-validations using leave-one-out
folding, and with the -w flag to weight the results using class prevalences.

```sh
./vhamnn explore -w -x -c -e -g datasets/breast-cancer-wisconsin-disc.tab
```
Note the additional flags: -x to exclude missing values; -c to exploit 
parallel processing by using all the available CPU cores on your machine;
-e to show extended results; -g to have plots of the results.
```sh
A correct classification to "malignant" is a True Positive (TP);
A correct classification to "benign" is a True Negative (TN).

```

While using all 9 attributes gives the best classification result (balanced accuracy 95.8%; F1 Score 0.944) using only 2 attributes gives the lowest false positive rate.
Picking the best combination of attributes to be used, and bin range when
there are continuous attributes, is often a matter of experience and judgment.

Let us train our classifier using 4 attributes:

```sh
./vhamnn make -a 4 -w -s datasets/breast-cancer-wisconsin-disc.tab 
```
```sh
Classifier for "datasets/breast-cancer-wisconsin-disc.tab"
created: 2021-05-30 02:24:26 UTC, with hamnn version: 0.1.0
options: missing values included when calculating rank values

Bare Nuclei                 D          11
Single Epithelial Cell Size D          10
```

We can use this trained classifier as a clinical calculator, to classify a new sample of breast tissue (with values of 8, 9, 7, and 8 for the four attributes identified above) as either malignant or benign:

```sh
./vhamnn query -a 4 -w datasets/breast-cancer-wisconsin-disc.tab
```
```sh
Possible values for "Uniformity of Cell Size": ['1', '4', '8', '10', '2', '3', '7', '5', '6', '9']
Please enter one of these values for attribute "Uniformity of Cell Size": 8
Possible values for "Uniformity of Cell Shape": ['1', '4', '8', '10', '2', '3', '5', '6', '7', '9']
Please enter one of these values for attribute "Uniformity of Cell Shape": 9
Possible values for "Bare Nuclei": ['1', '10', '2', '4', '3', '9', '7', '?', '5', '8', '6']
Please enter one of these values for attribute "Bare Nuclei": 7
Possible values for "Single Epithelial Cell Size": ['2', '7', '3', '1', '6', '4', '5', '8', '10', '9']
Please enter one of these values for attribute "Single Epithelial Cell Size": 8
Your responses were:
Uniformity of Cell Size 8
Uniformity of Cell Shape 9
Bare Nuclei        7
Single Epithelial Cell Size 8
Do you want to proceed? (y/n) y
For the classes ['benign', 'malignant'] the prevalence-weighted nearest neighbor counts are [0, 1832], so the inferred class is 'malignant'
```

The classifier imputes the class of the new sample as malignant. This is based on finding 1832 "malignant" nearest neighbours, vs no "benign" nearest neighbours (weighted values; without weighting by class prevalence, the nearest
neighbour counts would be 4 for malignant and 0 for benign).

In the real world, important information may not be available. Suppose we have a breast tissue sample where we only have information on the uniformity of cell shape which has a value of 2, and single epithelial cell size with a value of 3:

```sh
./vhamnn query -a 4 -w datasets/breast-cancer-wisconsin-disc.tab
```
```sh
Possible values for "Uniformity of Cell Size": ['1', '4', '8', '10', '2', '3', '7', '5', '6', '9']
Please enter one of these values for attribute "Uniformity of Cell Size":  
Possible values for "Uniformity of Cell Shape": ['1', '4', '8', '10', '2', '3', '5', '6', '7', '9']
Please enter one of these values for attribute "Uniformity of Cell Shape": 2
Possible values for "Bare Nuclei": ['1', '10', '2', '4', '3', '9', '7', '?', '5', '8', '6']
Please enter one of these values for attribute "Bare Nuclei": 
Possible values for "Single Epithelial Cell Size": ['2', '7', '3', '1', '6', '4', '5', '8', '10', '9']
Please enter one of these values for attribute "Single Epithelial Cell Size": 3
Your responses were:
Uniformity of Cell Size 
Uniformity of Cell Shape 2
Bare Nuclei        
Single Epithelial Cell Size 3
Do you want to proceed? (y/n) y
For the classes ['benign', 'malignant'] the prevalence-weighted nearest neighbor counts are [241, 0], so the inferred class is 'benign'
```

This sample is classified as benign, with weighted nearest neighbours 241 for and none against this inferred classification.
